            **BevLat** is a site for practicing your Latin word forms (morphology). 
            The goal is to create randomly-requested forms correctly, 
            allowing you to both reinforce your existing knowledge 
            and discover from your incorrect answers where your knowledge of forms may be weak. 
            You can practice nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, verbal adjectives (i.e., participles and gerundives), and pronouns.
            """)

st.markdown("""
            BevLat is **data driven**, drawing on your response history 
            to test you more frequently on forms you struggle with, 
            based on a fine-grained analysis of sub-categories within each part of speech. 
            You can also see on the Statistics & Data page which larger categories you may most need to review.
            """)

st.markdown("""
            BevLat is also highly **customizable**: 
            you can specify exactly what you want to practice within a given part of speech,
            and you can set your personal preferences for things like macrons (long-marks), case order, 
            and what information you're given about a word.

st.markdown("""
            All of these features work best with a **free account**, 
            which saves your data (answer history and preferred settings) across sessions; 
            otherwise, everything resets on each visit (or even after a temporary network disconnect). 
            You can sign in on the User Account page using any Google account.

            </summary>

            To get started, choose a **part of speech** that you want to practice. 
            You can find the parts of speech either in the sidebar navigation menu 
            (if it's not currently open, click on the :material/keyboard_double_arrow_right: at the top left of your screen)
            or in the menu at the bottom of each page.

            Each part of speech has many customizable options so that BevLat tests you at your level of knowledge and preferences.
            For instance, if you haven't learned all the forms of a given part of speech yet
            (e.g., if you only know present indicative verbs, or you only know first and second declension nouns),
            you can limit your practice to just the forms you know. 
            Similarly, if there are particular forms or irregular words that you specifically want to practice, you can choose to target those.
            My advice is to start with more limited options while you're just learning a particular set of forms 
            and then to progressively add in other forms as you start to feel more confident.
            If a question shows up that you don't have any idea about 
            (e.g., if you only know nominative and accusative forms but you get asked for a dative),
            you can just skip the question.

            By default, all options are selected for each part of speech. 
            Remove all the options that you don't want to include 
            (if you only want to keep a couple of options, 
            it may be faster to remove them all by clicking the :material/cancel: symbol 
            at the far right of the field, and add them back one by one). 
            If you're unsure about what exactly a particular option will do, 
            you can get more information by hovering over the relevant :material/help: symbol.

            Once you've selected your options, generate your first question by clicking on the red button that says 
            :color[Click here for your first question!]{foreground="white" background="red"}. 
            After you've clicked on it once, the button will just be labeled 'New Question' for the remainder of your session, across all parts of speech.

            After you've answered some questions, visit the **Stats & Data page**, 
            which gives you a downloadable record of your answers 
            *and also* suggested categories to review within a given part of speech, 
            based on your correct and incorrect answers.

            You can use all the features of BevLat without an account. 
            However, creating an account (by simply logging in with Google) will improve your user experience. 
            In particular, your answer history will be saved across sessions, 
            meaning that the adaptive learning algorithm will be more functional, 
            the Stats & Data page will have a more accurate assessment of your weak spots, 
            and you won't lose your progress if you lose your internet connection. 
            (BevLat can't be used offline, but if you're signed in, your answers will be restored when your connection is restored.)
            An account also allows you to save your preferred settings (such as which declensions you want to practice) 
            so that you don't have to reset them each time you change between parts of speech.

            If you still have questions, you may find some helpful answers on the **FAQ page**; 
            and if you still have questions after that, please feel free to [contact me](https://forms.gle/xT8hQ27sjposeXPc9).
