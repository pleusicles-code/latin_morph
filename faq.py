                There are two main reasons to make a user account.
                
                First, one of the major unique features of BevLat is its adaptive learning algorithm, 
                which makes it so that you're more likely to be asked about forms that you struggle with, 
                although still in a randomized fashion. 
                This functions better when it has more data about your prior answers to draw on, 
                so by signing in and preserving your answer history across sessions, 
                you're enabling the algorithm to function better for you.

                Second, if there are settings that you find yourself having to constantly reset to your preferences 
                (whether display settings or customizations such as which forms or irregulars to include), 
                logging in enables you to save these settings across sessions.

                Additionally, by making a user account, you have the option 
                to let your answers contribute to academic research on Latin pedagogy and language learning!

                The idea of BevLat is that it can help you develop your comfort with word *forms* even without knowing all of the words,

                (in which case, the irregular stem will also be displayed) or if the form is entirely irregular.

                **Pronouns** have no special display options: you should only practice pronouns that you've already encountered.
